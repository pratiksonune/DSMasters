        "Linear regression models are used to predict a continuous numerical value as the dependent variable, while logistic regression models are used to predict the probability of a binary outcome as the dependent variable. In other words, linear regression is used for regression problems, while logistic regression is used for classification problems.\n",

        "For example, if you want to predict the price of a house based on its size, location, and other factors, you would use a linear regression model. On the other hand, if you want to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on their age, gender, income, and other factors, you would use a logistic regression model.\n",

        "In scenarios where the dependent variable is categorical or binary, logistic regression is more appropriate. For instance, if a hospital is looking to predict the probability of a patient having a certain medical condition based on their age, gender, symptoms, and other factors, logistic regression would be a suitable model to use. The outcome variable, in this case, would be binary, with a value of 0 indicating that the patient does not have the condition and 1 indicating that they do. In such a case, logistic regression would help to estimate the probability of the patient having the medical condition based on the given factors."
