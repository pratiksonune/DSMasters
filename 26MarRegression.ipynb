The parameters are then updated by subtracting a fraction of the gradient from their current values. This fraction is called the learning rate and determines the size of the steps taken towards the minimum of the cost function. The algorithm continues to update the parameters iteratively until the cost function reaches a minimum or convergence criteria are met.\n",

It is particularly useful when the cost function is non-linear or non-convex and when there are many parameters to optimize. However, gradient descent can also be sensitive to the choice of the learning rate and the initial values of the model parameters, which may require careful tuning to obtain good results."

        "Multicollinearity is a common issue in multiple linear regression where two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other, making it difficult to distinguish their individual effects on the dependent variable. This can lead to unstable and unreliable estimates of the regression coefficients, as well as reduced predictive accuracy of the model.\n",

        "Multicollinearity can be detected through various methods, such as correlation matrices, variance inflation factors (VIFs), and eigenvalues. Correlation matrices show the correlations between all pairs of independent variables, with high correlations indicating possible multicollinearity. VIFs measure the amount of variance that each independent variable explains in the regression model, after controlling for the effects of all other independent variables. VIFs greater than 10 are often considered indicative of severe multicollinearity.\n",

This can be done by examining the correlations between the independent variables and the dependent variable, as well as their correlations with each other, to determine which variables are the most important for explaining the variation in the dependent variable. Alternatively, dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) or partial least squares regression (PLSR) can be used to combine highly correlated independent variables into fewer components or latent variables, which can be used in the regression model instead of the original independent variables.\n",
