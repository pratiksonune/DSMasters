        "Lasso Regression is a linear regression technique used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is a regularized regression technique that performs both variable selection and regularization to prevent overfitting.\n",
        "> In Lasso Regression, the objective is to minimize the sum of the squared residuals (i.e., the difference between the actual and predicted values) subject to a constraint on the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients. This constraint causes some of the coefficients to be shrunk towards zero, leading to a sparse model where only a subset of the independent variables have non-zero coefficients. This property of Lasso Regression makes it useful for feature selection and model interpretability.Indented block\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared to other regression techniques like Ridge Regression and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression, Lasso Regression is more suitable for datasets with a large number of features and a small sample size. While Ridge Regression shrinks all coefficients towards zero, Lasso Regression can completely eliminate some coefficients from the model, making it more effective in dealing with multicollinearity among the independent variables. Additionally, Lasso Regression can be used for variable selection and can help to identify the most important predictors in the model. In contrast, OLS Regression does not perform any variable selection or regularization and can lead to overfitting when the number of features is large."

        "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it can automatically select the most important features for the prediction task and exclude the less important ones. This is done by introducing a regularization term in the objective function that penalizes the magnitude of the regression coefficients.\n",
