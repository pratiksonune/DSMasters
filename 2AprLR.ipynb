Hyperparameters are parameters in a machine learning algorithm that are not learned from the data but are set by the user prior to the training of the model. The hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. For example, in a support vector machine (SVM), the regularization parameter C and the kernel function are hyperparameters.\n",

The algorithm then evaluates the performance of each model using cross-validation, and selects the set of hyperparameters that produces the best performance.\n",

It occurs when information that should only be available during testing or prediction is used in the model training process.\n",

The training data is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and select the best model. The test set is then used to evaluate the final performance of the selected model. It is important to ensure that no data from the validation or test sets is used in the model training process.\n",

This technique ensures that each data point is used in the training process and helps to prevent overfitting and data leakage.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Carefully preprocess the data: Data preprocessing is an important step in machine learning, and it is important to ensure that no information is leaked during this process. For example, if you are scaling the data, you should ensure that the scaling factors are computed only on the training data and then applied to the validation and test data.\n",
