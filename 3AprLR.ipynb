        "To understand these concepts better, consider the example of a spam filter. In this case, precision measures the proportion of correctly identified spam messages out of all messages labeled as spam by the filter. A high precision indicates that the filter rarely mislabels non-spam messages as spam. Recall, on the other hand, measures the proportion of all actual spam messages that were correctly identified by the filter. A high recall indicates that the filter correctly identifies a large proportion of all spam messages.\n",

In practice, a good classification model should strike a balance between precision and recall, depending on the specific application and the cost of each type of error."

This approach can be viewed as a generalization of the binary logistic regression to handle multiple classes.
